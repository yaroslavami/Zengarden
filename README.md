## Brief intro

The code provided is the entire Zengarden project. It's a popular online experiment in CSS-based web design, started by Dan Cederholm.

### Explanation

In the project, 100 designers from around the world have been invited to redesign the same webpage. They are provided with a clean, standard HTML code of a simple webpage, along with a small set of guidelines and constraints. The result is a rich showcase of the diverse possibilities and power of CSS in designing and creating a modern web page.

### Where to look

Each design has been uploaded to the project website and presented within a small iframe, to ensure consistent display regardless of the actual HTML or CSS code.

#### Interested in?

If you're interested in studying each design in more detail, you can view the individual submission pages by visiting the Zengarden website and browsing through the submissions.
